# WC5E CR Calculator

Source code for https://wc5e-cr-calculator.frogvall.com/

I did not originally write this code. The code was written by [/u/ItsADnDMonsterNow](https://www.reddit.com/user/ItsADnDMonsterNow) and can be found [here](https://iadndmn.neocities.org/CRcalc.html). I modified the code to take the WC5e modfied monster table into account and added code for generating calculations from url, as well as fixing several bugs oriented around CR < 1.
With 2.0, I also added a spell damage calculator. Spell list with damage values was made by [AceAzzermeen](https://github.com/AceAzzermeen).
